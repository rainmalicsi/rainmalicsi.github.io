          <h3>Childhood Years:</h3>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me share a story from my childhood.<sup>1</sup> I came from a happy and healthy family.<sup>2</sup> As the youngest of five children (two sisters and two brothers), I was blessed to have them.<sup>3</sup> They taught me everything important in life.<sup>4</sup> I grew up in a place where street games were popular.<sup>5</sup> Cell phones weren't common yet, so we enjoyed a childhood filled with real-life experiences.<sup>6</sup> So masaya akong nakikilala ang aking mga kababata at classmates na silang naging kaaway at kaibigan ko.<sup>7</sup> There were times when friendships started with titigan, angasan, sigaan na syang nag dudulot ng malaking pag aaway.<sup>8</sup> But as time passed, we'd eventually become playmates and friends.<sup>9</sup> Some might see this as a negative part of childhood, but I think it's just another story to tell.<sup>10</sup> The world is full of cruel and rude people, and you need to know how to stand up for yourself.<sup>11</sup> I was bullied from kindergarten until first grade.<sup>12</sup> Then, I met many friends in school who helped me overcome the bullies.<sup>13</sup> We played plenty of street games like tumbang preso, luksong baka, piko, paway, patintero, and many more that were so much fun.<sup>14</sup> My mother would always shout my name para umuwi at maligo dahil sa dami ng pawis na nakuha ko sa pag lalaro.<sup>15</sup> The same went for school; I was always busy joining events and games, which sometimes made me sick.<sup>16</sup> When I turned nine, these games were still popular, but kids were also getting into dancing.<sup>17</sup> I was fascinated and impressed.<sup>18</sup> The dance was called "Jerk," or some people called it "Harlem Shake."<sup>19</sup> It's a really cool dance where you should be creative for a footstep or hand signs.<sup>20</sup> I remember I joined the group DP performed and got in, but because of study, I couldn't join meetings and gatherings, so I left.<sup>21</sup> Around the age of ten or eleven, I discovered new games on the computer: Crossfire, League of Legends, Rules of Survival, Left 4 Dead, and many more.<sup>22</sup> I spent more than 40 pesos a day just to play computer games at the internet cafe.<sup>23</sup> I played games with my kababata but sometimes with new people who were more challenging.<sup>24</sup> Every day, I played for more than three and a half hours, but it came with a condition.<sup>25</sup> After I played, I needed to go to sleep.<sup>26</sup> It is because I get what I want, and dapat sumunod ako kay mama.<sup>27</sup> One day, my mother was so angry because I'd been at the computer shop for too long.<sup>28</sup> She complained that I wasn't home because I stayed at the computer shop for eight hours.<sup>29</sup> I understood her and just followed her wishes.<sup>30</sup> Ilang estudyante ako ay masayang nag-aaral.<sup>31</sup> Even though I had a hard time understanding the lessons, I tried my best to keep up so I wouldn't be left behind.<sup>32</sup> As a child of my parents, I was a good kid who always kept my promise to help them with chores.<sup>33</sup> Ang saya lang alalahanin ang mga memories na kinalakihan ko.<sup>34</sup> Life is completely different.<sup>35</sup> Yung ibang kababata ko ay merong nang pamilya, trabaho, o kanya-kanyang diskarte, di tulad ng dati na masayang naglalaro, walang problema, na ang tanging problema ay anong lalaruin at anong kakainin bilang meryenda.<sup>36</sup> I'm really happy to share my childhood memory.<sup>37</sup> It was really full of joy and smiles, and I wonder if I can ever go back to the past.<sup>38</sup><br></br>

                <h3>Teenage Years:</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's revisit my teenage years.<sup>1</sup> As a teen, I explored various interests, from writing, tagging, and graffiti, electrical-related and many more.<sup>2</sup> I also tried out badminton, futsal, and even ML tournaments, and joined organizations like the robotics and electrical teams in high school.<sup>3</sup> It all began in 7th grade.<sup>4</sup> My cousins, who were in the TVE program, told me how fun the electricity subject was, so I decided to give it a try, and I ended up really enjoying it.<sup>5</sup> Early in 7th grade, I was quite introverted, making only four friends the entire year.<sup>6</sup> However, I did meet a gorgeous, smart, strong, and independent girl.<sup>7</sup> At the end of the school year, when all the books were being returned, I saw her in line.<sup>8</sup> She glanced at me, smiled, and I decided to take a chance.<sup>9</sup> I walked right up to her and said, "Hello, you're beautiful!" and introduced myself.<sup>10</sup> She simply turned and walked away.<sup>11</sup> I was crushed.<sup>12</sup> I figured I wasn't her type.<sup>13</sup> When 8th grade started, I found her on Facebook, added her as a friend, and messaged her, explaining that I didn't mean to scare her.<sup>14</sup> She replied, and we started talking.<sup>15</sup> That year, I had a great group of friends.<sup>16</sup> Our class had 50 students, 42 boys and only 8 girls so it was a tight-knit group.<sup>17</sup> I loved the electricity classes because my classmates and I worked together to solve problems.<sup>18</sup> My family and friends were also a huge support system during high school.<sup>19</sup> Sometime during the second grading period of 8th grade, that girl I had met became my girlfriend.<sup>20</sup> I was so happy, and we're still together today.<sup>21</sup> After 8th and 9th grade came 10th grade, which was completely different because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup>22</sup> Many schools switched to online learning.<sup>23</sup> COVID-19 cases were high in our area (Pembo, Makati, Taguig), and our old elementary school even became a quarantine facility.<sup>24</sup><br></br>

                <h3>College Years:</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My college experience has been fun so far, I think.<sup>1</sup> Back in elementary and high school, I only attended public schools.<sup>2</sup> Starting at a private school for the first time, I didn't know how to interact and felt mixed emotions.<sup>3</sup> Happiness, excitement, and especially nervousness since I didn't have any friends.<sup>4</sup> New school, new faces, new professors definitely new missions.<sup>5</sup> In my first year as a college student, I felt lost regarding my subjects.<sup>6</sup> Our former professor in UE Comprog 1 wasn't very good at teaching.<sup>7</sup> When I met my classmates and we became friends, I asked them about the subject, and they helped me a lot, even tutoring me.<sup>8</sup> I can't really compare how difficult college is compared to high school.<sup>9</sup> If you were relaxed before, college is different; you need to be attentive and active academically.<sup>10</sup> I would say that tuition is a waste of money if you don't take college seriously.<sup>11</sup> Even I struggle with exams, but I'm still trying to survive.<sup>12</sup> You can feel the struggle in college, the last-minute cramming because of early deadlines, the commute to school, the loss of sleep, and much more.<sup>13</sup> But somehow, I feel relief.<sup>14</sup> There are only a few more semesters to finish before I graduate and finally start working.<sup>15</sup> I know working is hard, but thatâ€™s the reality we need to face.<sup>16</sup> If I ever feel pressure, I will consider it a studying technique.<sup>17</sup> My college experience has been enjoyable thus far.<sup>18</sup> I am happy with how my college journey is progressing.<sup>19</sup> I am grateful for the positive experiences I have had in college so far.<sup>20</sup><br><br>
