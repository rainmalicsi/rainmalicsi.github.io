            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, let's see how many skills I have.<sup>1</sup> First, let's look at hard skills, like cooking.<sup>2</sup> Since I was a kid, I've been amazed by my father's delicious cooking.<sup>3</sup> Hoping to achieve that myself, I'm now quite good at it.<sup>4</sup> Some of my favorite dishes to make are pesto pasta, onion rings, and burritos, among others.<sup>5</sup> In addition to cooking, I consider playing an instrument another valuable skill.<sup>6</sup> It's challenging to learn; it took me five months just to learn one song.<sup>7</sup> I also wish I could learn coding, data analysis, and especially graphic design.<sup>8</sup> As for soft skills, problem-solving is one of my strengths.<sup>9</sup> I enjoy watching movies with plot twists to sharpen my thinking.<sup>10</sup> I do forget things occasionally, but that's part of life, and I'm working on improving.<sup>11</sup> Another soft skill I have is critical thinking.<sup>12</sup> Over time, I've noticed that the calmest person in a situation is often the one who finds the solution.<sup>13</sup><br></br>

                <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll tell you about my hobbies, though I have to admit, I don't have many.<sup>1</sup> My main hobby, which I do regularly, is riding my motorcycle.<sup>2</sup> From Monday until Sunday, I always drive; it is because Monday to Thursday I have school, I use my motorcycle to go to school.<sup>3</sup> On Friday until Sunday, I usually help at our mini carinderia, I deliver food in BGC with my motorcycle and do all of that hassle for extra income for gas and etc.<sup>4</sup> When I'm free and have friends, we usually do rides, Tagaytay, Rizal, Infanta, Angono, those are the usual spots for rides.<sup>5</sup> I have this thing, a thing that I don't like messy places or messy rooms.<sup>6</sup> I want to clean every messy room that I see; I am strict when it comes to chores.<sup>7</sup> Why? Because it's the house where you live, we need to have a clean and safe spot so that we can have a healthy life; my favorite chore is washing dishes and mopping the whole house.<sup>8</sup> Also, it comes to my second hobby, doing household chores.<sup>9</sup> Since I was 7, my mother taught me to clean every time I made a mess, yet I thank her for that because it's not hard for me to learn that type of thing.<sup>10</sup> Besides household chores, I like to repair things, fixing electric fans and cleaning air conditioners, making extension cords, fixing light bulbs, and many more.<sup>11</sup> I've been a candidate in the NC2 division for the electrical practical exam.<sup>12</sup> Way back when I was in senior high school, I had this real deal hobby where putting tags or doing graffiti drawing and being creative and artistic.<sup>13</sup> My other hobby is customizing thrift finds, making shorts out of jeans, making custom fur for jackets.<sup>14</sup> I also love to do refreshes of caps, fitted caps, snap backs, strap backs, dad hats, and any variant of caps.<sup>15</sup> I do want to try to be a mechanic in my friend's shop; I want to explore and make my mind wider so that I can have other rackets.<sup>16</sup> Ultimately, I find joy in creating and fixing things; it gives me a sense of accomplishment.<sup>17</sup> I'm always looking for new skills to learn and new hobbies to explore, even if it's just trying a new recipe.<sup>18</sup> One day, I hope to combine my love for motorcycles and fixing things into a small business.<sup>19</sup><br></br>

                <h3>Interests:</h3>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to interests, I prefer those that yield profits.<sup>1</sup> Where you can gain investment and enjoy the things you're interested in.<sup>2</sup> My primary interests include gathering orders for my brother-in-law's printing company, showcasing different services such as tarpaulin printing and research paper production, contributing to a stable income stream.<sup>3</sup> I also focus on painting or powder coating different kinds of fairings on motorcycle parts.<sup>4</sup> During the last pandemic, I invested in Axie Infinity, a game where you fight and earn SLP or points if you win.<sup>5</sup> This experience taught me the potential of digital assets and the evolving landscape of online income generation.<sup>6</sup> Additionally, my sister and I ventured into the clothing industry, creating a line called 'HKN MTT,' meaning 'Hakuna Matata'.<sup>7</sup> For several months, business was good, gaining bulk orders and restocks for past designs and newest designs.<sup>8</sup> However, due to the pandemic-related economic downturn, customer demand was significantly lower than before, leading us to reassess our business strategy.<sup>9</sup> Other than my other interests, I also love collecting vintage clothes, pants, caps, hoodies, shoes, and different kinds of vintage items.<sup>10</sup> In addition, way back in 2022, I was a reseller of disposable vapes, where I made a profit and ordered several appliances for our home.<sup>11</sup> I also met a lot of people where I can learn more and apply in real life, planning in the future to invest in buying and selling motorcycles and start a small sari-sari store.<sup>12</sup> Hoping to be a good IT programmer, enabling me to efficiently manage multiple projects and side hustles, and create automated systems to handle repetitive tasks.<sup>13</sup> I like doing things that make money and are fun.<sup>14</sup> I found out that you can make money in many ways, like selling things, playing games online, or even making clothes.<sup>15</sup> Sometimes, things don't work out.<sup>16</sup> But I learned that it's important to try different things and learn from them.<sup>17</sup> I also learned that talking to people and making friends is very helpful.<sup>18</sup> I want to learn computers so I can do more things easily and make my work better.<sup>19</sup><br><br>
