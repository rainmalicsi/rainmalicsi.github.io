One example is my knowledge about rubik's cube. Even tho I'm not that fast, my record is 13 seconds and it's not that bad. I memorized all of the PLL algorithm or also known as permutated last layer. The other skill I have is my knowledge about Microsoft office apps like Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. I know some basic keyboard shortcuts and features. I am also a fast learner, able to quickly grasp new concepts and skills.  My abilities extend to gaming, where I am proficient at playing Valorant. I also have knowledge of cryptocurrency trading. I have experience trading on TON and Solana network, and I can say that it's not that bad.  Furthermore, I am capable of managing household chores, demonstrating my responsibility in everyday life. One skill I can be proud of is my cooking. I know how to cook a variety of Filipino foods and I can say that it is one of my best assets.</blockquote></blockquote>

            <blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh hobbies!!! I have so many hobbies in my life. Even when I was a kid, I love watching television shows with my brother. Especially now that my mom's friend let us borrow her Netflix account, we now have more time to watch some series and movies. One of my favorite hobby is solving a 3x3 rubik's cube. When I have free time, I am watching some tutorials in youtube to improve my speed at solving it. My next hobby is doing some household chores. I love helping my mom on house duties because I will get scolded when I did not do it. Helping my mom in doing the chores is one of my way saying I love her. Another one for my hobby is playing valorant. I spend a lot of money just to enjoy playing valorant. Every time I play, I got relaxed all the time. I also love playing roblox during our labaratory time in HCI. solving a 3x3 cube and other puzzles like pyraminx and 2x2 relaxes my mind and I believe that it boosts my way of thinking. I have a hobby of listening to music especially while doing some activities. Also during free time, when I'm in the mood, I open my laptop and start doing some coding. During Saturday, I go to the gym to do some workouts. By the way, it's just my second time on going to the gym and I am a new member. It is one of my new year resolution and I'm happy I'm doing it. Oh before I forgot, every time my brother goes home from work, we will play some pinoy henyo. It is a game where there is a pair, and one will guess the word and the other one is the one andwering yes or no. We play pinoy henyo most of the times because it's enjoyable amd thrilling at the same time. We also compare ourselves to other pair, and find out who's better. I always feel proud every time I answer a word in just seconds. Watching tv gameshows is also one of my hobbies. It is engaging and we also answer to the questions. When I get bored inside the house, I'll just talk to to my cats and do some cuddles.

            <blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest, hmmm. As days goes by and as I was getting older, my interest in life changes. Back then when I was a kid, I am dreaming on becoming a soldier or a policeman. But the change of my mind lead me here, an IT student, dreaming to be an expert. I think some of my interests falls on technology. Even when I was a kid, I always wonder how certain things work, how they managed to do them, and more. I have intersts too on film making industry especially abroad. I love criticizing series and movies that focuses on action, thriller, and crime genres. I am always amazed on how CGI works. The editing, visual effects, sounds etc., were always amzing to me. I even dreamed of becoming a cameraman before lol. Oh, and one of my favorite interests is about food. I love cooking. I just realized lately that I have interest in food industry. It all started when I watched a viral video of Uncle Roger on pandemic, whereas he reviewed a video of a british washing rice using a colander. His humor caught me and he loves to criticise foods using his humor. I think I got my cooking skills from my father, because I always watch and I help him when he is cooking. I know basic cooking like saut√©ing, stir-fry, stew, saucy foods and more. I can cook common Filipino foods like Adobo, Sinigang, and more. I even idolizes Gordon Ramsay, a world-renowed chef known from his Beef Wellington. I also dreamed tasting a medium-well steak because I haven't tasted one. I also realized that if I didn't take IT, my second option will be studying in culinary school. Another interest of mine  is the world of e-sports and the things behind it. The setup of computers, the replay system, casters, observers, and more. My interest in computer still grows as I'm doing my best to buy one with the best specs in the world! I think that's it and I hope many interest comes to my mind someday.</blockquote></blockquote>
