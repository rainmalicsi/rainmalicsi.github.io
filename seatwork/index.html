                <blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rain David Malicsi was born in <i>Malabon City</i> on 13th of September 2005, growing up in a loving family.<sup>1</sup> From an early age, he loves playing outside.<sup>2</sup> Back on his childhood days, all he love
                to do is to study, play with his neighbors, and spend time with his family.<sup>3</sup> His mom told
                him when he was little is to study hard for his better future.<sup>4</sup> He is a consistent academic
                achiever, from kindergarten to elementary school.<sup>5</sup> Back then, he purely focus on studying.<sup>6</sup>
                One of his earliest memories is going home after a very tiring period of endless playing
                with his friends.<sup>7</sup> Despite being a good student, he still <ins>managed</ins> to spend time with his
                friends without affecting his studies.<sup>8</sup> His childhood was filled with learning and adventure.<sup>9</sup>
                Whether it was going through tough times, or successfully getting what he want, he was
                always thankful to Lord.<sup>10</sup> When he was a kid, even until now, his family always goes to the
                church every Sunday.<sup>11</sup> As time goes on, he joined one of the ministries in the church, where
                they will be reading the word of the Lord in the altar.<sup>12</sup> Looking back, he can say that his
                childhood was a mix of surprise and mischief.<sup>13</sup> The weekends, where his favorite days
                belong, filled with the sound of laughter, wounds on knees, and adventures.<sup>14</sup> From an
                early age, he was blessed with a family that guided him to be a kind person.<sup>15</sup> There are
                lessons, tips, advices that he kept on his mind.<sup>16</sup> He spent most of his childhood enjoying the
                life he want.<sup>17</sup> Growing up in a middle-class family, life was not always <strong>easy</strong>.<sup>18</sup> He learned early
                on that resilience and determination would push him to become a better person.<sup>19</sup> He love
                being a child, and he miss being a child.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote></blockquote>

            <br>
            <blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Rain stepped into his teenage years, his way of thinking changed, he began to
                understand more his purpose in this life.<sup>1</sup> The world seemed bigger, and so did his
                dreams.<sup>2</sup> Being a teenager brings responsibilities.<sup>3</sup> During his teenage years, he was also
                enjoying his life being a teen full of ambitions.<sup>4</sup> His teenage life is simple.<sup>5</sup> He go to school,
                spend time with his classmates, go home, and it just repeats as days go by.<sup>6</sup> If he was an
                academic achiever back when he was a kid, then it is the complete opposite when he became
                a teenager.<sup>7</sup> Even though he have dreams, he lost his will to study hard back in high school.<sup>8</sup>
                He thinks it was because of the influence of his classmates, where they are just chilling.<sup>9</sup> His
                teenage years were a time of uncertainty, routine, and silent struggles.<sup>10</sup> He was not
                particularly passionate about anything.<sup>11</sup> He simply went to school, did what was expected,
                and spent his free time playing with friends.<sup>12</sup> Academics came with their own challenges,
                but he never saw himself as someone with a clear goal or direction.<sup>13</sup> Instead, he just went
                with the flow, following whatever life brought his way.<sup>14</sup> Then the pandemic happened,
                where the life of many has changed, including his.<sup>15</sup> At the time of pandemic, he was a
                senior high student, and it changes the way of his thinking.<sup>16</sup> He met new and solid friends
                and became more mature and cares about his future.<sup>17</sup> During this time, his passion for
                computers started and started dreaming to become an IT expert in the future.<sup>18</sup> This is
                where he started to become serious in life.<sup>19</sup> He lost many opportunities during his teenager
                life, and he hope it will not happen again in his college life.<sup>20</sup></p></blockquote></blockquote>

            <br>
            <blockquote><blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College life, the most important chapter of his life.<sup>1</sup> This is where he is starting to
                achieve his dreams, step by step, slowly but surely.<sup>2</sup> Even he is currently a sophomore, he
                experienced many things in his uni life.<sup>3</sup> On his first year, he is observing how the
                university works at first.<sup>4</sup> The schedules, professors, buildings and more.<sup>5</sup> As he enter the
                room, he was extremely nervous at first because he did not know anyone during that time.<sup>6</sup>
                But as days goes by, he met many people and built a good relationship with his block
                mates.<sup>7</sup> Being a clueless student without experience on the IT field, as we are being
                oriented by our professors, he was shocked by how big IT is.<sup>8</sup> This lit his heart to study
                harder to achieve his dreams.<sup>9</sup> But things do not go well.<sup>10</sup> There is a programming language
                that he struggle to understand due to some circumstances.<sup>11</sup> However, he still did his best to
                satisfy hisself.<sup>12</sup> Fortunately, he got into the academic achievers for the first-year students
                and got a chance to be a college scholar.<sup>13</sup> This served as his motivation to do better.<sup>14</sup> he did
                this while enjoying with his friends, hanging out with them and balancing his time to
                study.<sup>15</sup> On his sophomore phase, he still do his same routine.<sup>16</sup> And one time, he fell in love
                with his block mate.<sup>17</sup> We spent time together most of the time, watched movies, do some
                food trips and more.<sup>18</sup> Unfortunately, we did not end up together because he is too young
                for her.<sup>19</sup> During this time, he focuses on love, and he lost track of what he really wants, resulting
                to his GPA not reaching the minimum requirement for the scholarship.<sup>20</sup> This serves him a
                lesson to prioritize his studies and do better next time.<sup>21</sup></p></blockquote></blockquote>
