            <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Malabon City on 13th of September 2005, growing up in a loving
                family.<sup>1</sup> From an early age, I love playing outside.<sup>2</sup> Back on my childhood days, all I love
                to do is to study, play with my neighbors, and spend time with my family.<sup>3</sup> My mom told
                me when I was little is to study hard for my better future.<sup>4</sup> I am a consistent academic
                achiever, from kindergarten to elementary school.<sup>5</sup> Back then, I purely focus on studying.<sup>6</sup>
                One of my earliest memories is going home after a very tiring period of endless playing
                with my friends.<sup>7</sup> Despite being a good student, I still manage to spend time with my
                friends without affecting my studies.<sup>8</sup> My childhood was filled with learning and adventure.<sup>9</sup>
                Whether it was going through tough times, or successfully getting what I want, I was
                always thankful to Lord.<sup>10</sup> When I was a kid, even until now, my family always goes to the
                church every Sunday.<sup>11</sup> As time goes on, I joined one of the ministries in the church, where
                we will be reading the word of the Lord in the altar.<sup>12</sup> Looking back, I can say that my
                childhood was a mix of surprise and mischief.<sup>13</sup> The weekends, where my favorite days
                belong, filled with the sound of laughter, wounds on knees, and adventures.<sup>14</sup> From an
                early age, I was blessed with a family that guided me to be a kind person.<sup>15</sup> There are
                lessons, tips, advices that I kept on my mind.<sup>16</sup> I spent most of my childhood enjoying the
                life I want.<sup>17</sup> Growing up in a middle-class family, life was not always easy.<sup>18</sup> I learned early
                on that resilience and determination would push me to become a better person.<sup>19</sup> I love
                being a child, and I miss being a child.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

            <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I stepped into my teenage years, my way of thinking changed, I began to
                understand more my purpose in this life.<sup>1</sup> The world seemed bigger, and so did my
                dreams.<sup>2</sup> Being a teenager brings responsibilities.<sup>3</sup> During my teenage years, I was also
                enjoying my life being a teen full of ambitions.<sup>4</sup> My teenage life is simple.<sup>5</sup> I go to school,
                spend time with my classmates, go home, and it just repeats as days go by.<sup>6</sup> If I was an
                academic achiever back when I was a kid, then it is the complete opposite when I became
                a teenager.<sup>7</sup> Even though I have dreams, I lost my will to study hard back in high school.<sup>8</sup>
                I think it was because of the influence of my classmates, where they are just chilling.<sup>9</sup> My
                teenage years were a time of uncertainty, routine, and silent struggles.<sup>10</sup> I was not
                particularly passionate about anything.<sup>11</sup> I simply went to school, did what was expected,
                and spent my free time playing with friends.<sup>12</sup> Academics came with their own challenges,
                but I never saw myself as someone with a clear goal or direction.<sup>13</sup> Instead, I just went
                with the flow, following whatever life brought my way.<sup>14</sup> Then the pandemic happened,
                where the life of many has changed, including mine.<sup>15</sup> At the time of pandemic, I was a
                senior high student, and it changes the way of my thinking.<sup>16</sup> I met new and solid friends
                and became more mature and cares about my future.<sup>17</sup> During this time, my passion for
                computers started and started dreaming to become an IT expert in the future.<sup>18</sup> This is
                where I started to become serious in life.<sup>19</sup> I lost many opportunities during my teenager
                life, and I hope it will not happen again in my college life.<sup>20</sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

            <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College life, the most important chapter of my life.<sup>1</sup> This is where I am starting to
                achieve my dreams, step by step, slowly but surely.<sup>2</sup> Even I am currently a sophomore, I
                experienced many things in my uni life.<sup>3</sup> On my first year, I am observing how the
                university works at first.<sup>4</sup> The schedules, professors, buildings and more.<sup>5</sup> As I enter the
                room, I was extremely nervous at first because I did not know anyone during that time.<sup>6</sup>
                But as days goes by, I met many people and built a good relationship with my block
                mates.<sup>7</sup> Being a clueless student without experience on the IT field, as we are being
                oriented by our professors, I was shocked by how big IT is.<sup>8</sup> This lit my heart to study
                harder to achieve my dreams.<sup>9</sup> But things do not go well.<sup>10</sup> There is a programming language
                that I struggle to understand due to some circumstances.<sup>11</sup> However, I still did my best to
                satisfy myself.<sup>12</sup> Fortunately, I got into the academic achievers for the first-year students
                and got a chance to be a college scholar.<sup>13</sup> This served as my motivation to do better.<sup>14</sup> I did
                this while enjoying with my friends, hanging out with them and balancing my time to
                study.<sup>15</sup> On my sophomore phase, I still do my same routine.<sup>16</sup> And one time, I fell in love
                with my block mate.<sup>17</sup> We spent time together most of the time, watched movies, do some
                food trips and more.<sup>18</sup> Unfortunately, we did not end up together because I am too young
                for her.<sup>19</sup> During this time, I focuses on love, and I lost track of what I really wants, resulting
                to my GPA not reaching the minimum requirement for the scholarship.<sup>20</sup> This serves me a
                lesson to prioritize my studies and do better next time.<sup>21</sup></blockquote></blockquote>
